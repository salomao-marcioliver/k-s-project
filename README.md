# Simulator Objective

The simulator aims to provide a virtual environment for executing and viewing assembly language code.

## Functional Requirements:

- Code Entry: The simulator must allow code input in assembly language.
- Step by Step Execution: Users must be able to run the code step by step to observe the state of registers and memory.
- Viewing Registers and Memory: The simulator must provide an interface to view the contents of registers and memory.
- Basic Instruction Support: Implementation of basic assembly language instructions such as load, store, add, sub, jump, etc.

## Non-Functional Requirements:

- Efficiency: The simulator must execute instructions efficiently, providing a fluid user experience.
- Intuitive Interface: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use.
- Support for Different Browsers: Compatibility with the main web browsers.

## Establishment of the Project Scope:

### Included in the Scope:
- Development of a responsive user interface using React.
- Simulator core implementation capable of interpreting and executing assembly language code.
- Real-time visualization of the state of registers and memory during code execution.

### Exclusion from Scope:
- Support for multiple users in real time (if not required).
- Advanced features like code optimizations that are beyond the initial scope.
- Support a wide variety of assembly languages (focus on a starting set).

### Time Limits:
- Establish time frames for each phase of the project, ensuring compliance with stipulated delivery deadlines.

# Interface

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) software was used to build the interface and prototype of the project, demonstrating how the app screens and their functions would be built. To access the prototype [click here](https://www.figma.com/file/7xl5Fj0ukT7eycQj5Mecu6/Interface-K%26S?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=EzspFXlor75ikRUR-1).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Install dependencies

Initially, to gain access to some specific functionalities that will be used for this project, you need to open your computer's terminal and type the following command: 
```sh
npm i
```
Now that some dependencies have been installed to start a local development server. just type the command
``` sh
npm run dev
```
This command is specified in your `Node.js` project's [package.json](package.json) file, within the "scripts" section.
